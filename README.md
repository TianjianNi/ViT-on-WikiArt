In the project, we use the power of deep learning to classify famous artworksâ€™ genres. We experimented with different computer vision models such as Vision Transformer (ViT), Inception Transformer (iFormer), and ResNet-50. The results showed that ResNet-50 works the best in successfully classifying the genres among the tested models.
