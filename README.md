In the project, we use the power of deep neural networks to classify famous artworks’ genres. We experiment with different computer vision models such as Vision Transformer (ViT), Inception Transformer (iFormer), and ResNet-50. The results show that ResNet-50 works the best in successfully classifying the genres among the tested models.

The dataset used is called “Best Artworks of All Time”. The dataset is scraped from artchallenge.ru and collects the artworks from 50 influential artists of all time. For this project, we select 10 artists whose works are the best representatives of 10 genres. We will use Vision Transformer (ViT), Inception Transformer (iFormer), and ResNet-50 to classify the artworks. Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time
